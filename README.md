## **K8 Coffee Shop Overview**  
**Goal:**  
This application simulates the process of ordering coffee. The **Order Service** handles customer orders, while the **Inventory Service** manages stock availability. When a customer places an order, the Order Service checks with the Inventory Service to confirm if the requested coffee ingredients are in stock.

### **Communication Flow**  
1. **Customer places an order** by sending a request to the **Order Service**.
2. **Order Service** calls **Inventory Service** to **check stock availability**.
3. If the stock is **available**, Order Service confirms the order.
4. If the stock is **unavailable**, Order Service responds with suggested alternatives or an out-of-stock message.

### **Workflow Example**  
1. **Customer:**  
   - “I want a Large Cappuccino.”

2. **Order Service:**  
   - Checks with Inventory Service:  
     - “Do we have ingredients for Large Cappuccino?”

3. **Inventory Service:**  
   - Responds:  
     - “Milk is out of stock. Suggested alternatives: Espresso, Americano.”

4. **Order Service:**  
   - Sends a response to the customer:  
     - “Cappuccino is unavailable. Would you like an Espresso or Americano instead?”
